problem domain: time management 

our project: we are building an app that allows a group of friends to log the habits they engage in every day, set goals, and compare their progress. Each group will be able to determine its specific goals, and the goals will be grouped into more general categories such as "exercise", "study", "cleaning", etc. The specific tasks involved could be the child classes of the general categories. The final presentation of the project will be some sort of visual data representation that summarizes the hours that the group has logged for each habit, and whether if they have achieved their goals. 

API use case: we want users to be able to represent activities they log with emojis, so we are using an emoji api to get the unicodes of different emojis
