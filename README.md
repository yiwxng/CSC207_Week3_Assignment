problem domain: time management 

our project: we are building an app that allows a group of friends to log the habits they engage in every day, set goals, and compare their progress.

API use case: we want users to be able to represent activities they log with emojis, so we are using an emoji api to get the unicodes of different emojis 

API documentation: https://emoji-api.com
